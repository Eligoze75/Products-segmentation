## Products segmentation using clustering algorithms. 

### Description.
As a delivery app, you need to have the stock information of each product per store, so you can know if you can offer a product or not.   
Let's say you are not able to have visibility about your products stock on many intervals of time at the day. How can you avoid having stockout issues without a completely information?  
There are many ways to approach this question. One of them is using "*safe*" intervals of stock. You could get a minimum number of units in store so you can offer them and not present stockout. 

### Datasets.
* **Products-store data**: real stock, price, and average sale by product.
* **Stockouts and sales data**.
